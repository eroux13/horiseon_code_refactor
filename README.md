## Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to work with existing code and be able to refactor it as well as applying semantic HTML. The original code that was provided was not using semantic HTML elements, therefore making it difficult to read. 

The purpose of semantic elements is to help structure the code, making it more readable and easier to maintain. After refactoring the HTML, the elements now follow a logical structure, independent of styling and positioning. All the images in the HTML now have an alt attribute making it accessible for screen readers. The heading attributes fall in sequential order; lastly the title is concise and descriptive. 

As for the CSS, I consolidated the styling to make it more readable. I also rearranged the styling so that it matches the flow of the HTML.
